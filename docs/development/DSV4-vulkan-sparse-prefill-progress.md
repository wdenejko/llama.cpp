# DeepSeek V4 Vulkan sparse prefill progress

This file is a self-contained handoff for the DeepSeek V4 sparse-attention prompt-processing optimization on AMD Strix Halo. Read the repository `AGENTS.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md` before continuing.

## Repository state

- Repository: `https://github.com/Nathanw1014/llama.cpp`
- Branch: `strix-halo-vulkan`
- Starting commit: `baf0025de861c6f6ea3720fa81c52ae1b2e6c078`
- Target GPU: AMD Radeon 8060S / gfx1151, RADV, Vulkan, wave64
- The device reports `GL_KHR_cooperative_matrix`, f16 inputs with f32 accumulation, 64 KiB shared memory, and a maximum 512-thread workgroup used by this path.

The implementation is not upstream `ggml-org/llama.cpp`. It builds on this branch's DeepSeek V4 graph, Lightning Indexer, sparse top-K hint, decode gather path, fused HC kernels, and Vulkan profiler changes.

## Important execution constraints

The system is an APU. CPU compilation and GPU benchmarking share power and memory bandwidth. Never build and benchmark at the same time. Serialize all builds, correctness tests, and performance tests.

GPU commands must run with host GPU access. In an agent sandbox, request elevated/out-of-sandbox execution. A sandboxed benchmark showed only CPU activity and is invalid.

Redirect the full model benchmark to a log. Inspect only the last profiler block with `tail`; do not load the full log into agent context.

## Build and ccache

The build directory is `build`, configured as Release with Vulkan enabled. The default ccache directory was read-only in the agent environment, so use a writable directory:

```bash
cmake -S . -B build \
  -DGGML_VULKAN=ON \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
  -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER_LAUNCHER=ccache \
  -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_LAUNCHER=ccache

CCACHE_DIR=/tmp/llama-cpp-ccache cmake --build build --config Release \
  --target llama-bench test-backend-ops -j "$(nproc)"

CCACHE_DIR=/tmp/llama-cpp-ccache ccache -s
```

ccache was verified active. The final build reported direct hits. Note that an incremental change to `ggml-vulkan.cpp` is one large C++ translation unit and therefore uses one compiler core even with `-j`. Shader object regeneration can run in parallel.

## Canonical benchmark command

Do not change or omit switches for the 32k acceptance run:

```bash
GGML_VK_PERF_LOGGER=1 ./build/bin/llama-bench \
  -m ~/Projects/docker/localLLaMA/models/models--unsloth--DeepSeek-V4-Flash-0731-GGUF/snapshots/109848da2469efe1f1aab9e11acea08a065ccd4f/UD-IQ3_XXS/DeepSeek-V4-Flash-0731-UD-IQ3_XXS-00001-of-00004.gguf \
  -r 1 -d 32768 -p 2048 -ub 2048 -fa 1 -n 0 \
  > /tmp/dsv4-vulkan-32k.log 2>&1

tail -n 180 /tmp/dsv4-vulkan-32k.log
```

The known model path exists on the target system.

## Graph and dispatch findings

DeepSeek V4 builds the Lightning Indexer and sparse attention in `src/models/deepseek4.cpp`:

1. `build_lid_top_k()` creates indexer Q/K/weights and calls `ggml_lightning_indexer()`.
2. `ggml_top_k()` selects up to `hparams.indexer_top_k` compressed-cache indices for every query token.
3. `build_csa_lid_attention()` concatenates the raw SWA K prefix with compressed CSA K, builds a dense mask carrying the same sparse selection, and calls `build_attn_mha(..., top_k, raw_k->ne[2])`.
4. `build_attn_mha()` attaches `top_k` and `n_kv_raw` to `GGML_OP_FLASH_ATTN_EXT` through `ggml_flash_attn_ext_add_top_k()`.

At the final 32k PP2048 batch:

- total K rows: 11,008
- `n_kv_raw`: 2,304 raw SWA rows, always attended subject to the mask
- `n_top_k`: 512 selected compressed rows per query token
- active rows: 2,816
- selectable compressed region: 8,704

The custom Vulkan path is selected by `ggml_vk_flash_attn_top_k()` before ordinary FA. Its gate requires the DeepSeek V4 shape and `total_k >= 3 * (n_kv_raw + n_top_k)`. The final shape satisfies `11008 >= 3 * 2816`.

The old `flash_attn_top_k.comp` shader is scalar/subgroup code. One 512-thread workgroup covers eight heads for one query token. It stages 16 selected 512-wide K/V rows, computes QK with scalar FMAs and `subgroupAdd`, updates online softmax one key at a time, and accumulates PV manually. It does not use cooperative matrices.

The top-K set differs by query token but is shared by all 64 query heads for that token. This makes the attention for one token a regular matrix problem across heads and selected keys despite sparse per-token indexing.

## Root cause evidence

The existing Vulkan timestamp infrastructure was extended with `ggml_vk_perf_mark_subop()` after the sparse dispatch. This reports the sparse kernel separately as `FA_TOP_K_SPARSE (sub-op)` or `FA_TOP_K_CM (sub-op)`.

Focused test shape:

```bash
GGML_VK_PERF_LOGGER=1 ./build/bin/test-backend-ops perf \
  -b Vulkan0 -o FLASH_ATTN_EXT \
  -p 'kv=32768,nb=512,n_kv_raw=1024,n_top_k=512,sinks=0'
```

Results:

- old scalar sparse kernel: 61.42 ms, 1.68 TFLOPS of useful active-set work
- ordinary dense FA diagnostic (`GGML_VK_FA_TOPK=0`): 255.97 ms, about 8.7 TFLOPS over the full dense work
- final cooperative sparse kernel: 32.55 ms, 3.17 TFLOPS of useful active-set work

The residual `FLASH_ATTN_EXT` interval after the sparse timestamp is only about 4-7 us. The cost is inside the shader, not dispatch or surrounding synchronization.

A temporary uniform stage-profiling mode was used and removed. For the final 32-head tile:

- selected K gather + cooperative QK: 14.30 ms
- gather + QK + serial softmax: 26.34 ms
- gather + QK + parallel softmax: 15.53 ms
- full kernel: 32.55 ms
- the remaining cooperative PV/output portion is about 17.0 ms

The old scalar shader was compute/issue inefficient. Dense FA proved matrix hardware is much faster but was still too expensive because it processes all K rows. The final implementation preserves sparsity and uses the matrix hardware for both QK and PV.

## Implementation

Files changed:

- `ggml/src/ggml-vulkan/vulkan-shaders/flash_attn_top_k_cm.comp`
  - New cooperative-matrix sparse prefill shader.
  - One 512-thread workgroup covers 32 query heads for one token.
  - Eight wave64 subgroups cover two 16-head tiles by four 16-key or 16-output-dimension tiles.
  - Processes 64 selected keys per online-softmax block.
  - Stages only indexed selected K/V tiles, never the full K range.
  - Uses f16 cooperative-matrix inputs and f32 accumulation for QK and PV.
  - Uses a 16-lane segmented softmax per head. XOR subgroup shuffles reduce max and sum for four independent heads per wave without workgroup barriers.
  - Keeps f32 output accumulators and normalizes after all active blocks.
  - Preserves the raw prefix, top-K index validation, mask, sinks, stream strides, and K == V latent behavior.
- `ggml/src/ggml-vulkan/vulkan-shaders/vulkan-shaders-gen.cpp`
  - Embeds the new shader when cooperative-matrix shader support is available.
- `ggml/src/ggml-vulkan/ggml-vulkan.cpp`
  - Adds the cooperative sparse pipeline when the device supports the required 16x16x16 f16/f32 cooperative matrix shape.
  - Selects it by capability and keeps the scalar shader as fallback.
  - Adds `GGML_VK_FA_TOPK=0` to force ordinary dense FA for diagnostics.
  - Adds `GGML_VK_FA_TOPK_CM=0` to force the old scalar sparse shader for A/B tests.
  - Adds sparse sub-operation timestamps through the existing profiler.

The path is capability-based, not hardcoded to Strix Halo. The current sparse shape gate remains DeepSeek V4-specific. Devices without the required cooperative matrix support keep the correct scalar sparse or dense fallback.

Two discarded prototypes are useful context:

- A 16-head, 64-key streaming cooperative tile was correct and reduced the focused test from 61.4 to 44.6 ms.
- Keeping 32 complete 512-wide K/V rows in LDS grew shared memory to about 41 KiB, reduced residency, doubled block/barrier count, and regressed to 73.8 ms. Do not retry full-row LDS staging without solving occupancy.
- A 32-head, 64-key streaming tile halved irregular row loads but initially stayed near 44.7 ms because serial softmax cost about 11.5 ms. Parallel segmented softmax produced the final 32.55 ms result.

## Correctness validation

Run:

```bash
./build/bin/test-backend-ops test -b Vulkan0 -o FLASH_ATTN_EXT -p 'n_top_k='
```

Final result: 8/8 sparse top-K FA cases passed against the CPU reference. Cases include:

- decode and short batches that use dense/gather fallback
- sparse prefill batch sizes 64 and 128
- `n_kv_raw` plus top-K selection
- invalid top-K index handling from the test fixture
- sinks enabled and disabled
- sparse threshold transitions
- an active-key count of 193, which exercises a partial final 64-key block

The test uses the existing FA tolerance of NMSE <= `5e-4`. No NaN or Inf failure occurred. The implementation changes Q and probability inputs to f16 cooperative-matrix operands with f32 accumulation, matching the precision strategy of ordinary Vulkan cooperative FA.

Still desirable before broader submission:

- compare model logits on controlled prompts between `GGML_VK_FA_TOPK_CM=0` and the default cooperative path

## Canonical 32k results

Exact clean runs, same command and machine, no concurrent build:

```text
32k context, PP 2048, ub 2048

Before (commit baf0025de):
112.29 tok/s
Total Vulkan: 18.1957 s
Sparse FA: 8.84496 s, 421.189 ms/layer
Lightning Indexer: 1.19438 s
TOP_K: 0.076948 s

After:
152.32 tok/s
Total Vulkan: 13.4032 s
Sparse FA: 4.44701 s, 211.762 ms/layer
Lightning Indexer: 1.13156 s
TOP_K: 0.073945 s

Change:

Total Vulkan time: -26.34%
Sparse FA time: -49.72%
Sparse FA saved: 4.398 s
Total GPU time saved: 4.793 s
```

The profiler now lists the optimized dispatch as `FA_TOP_K_CM (sub-op)`. The following residual `FLASH_ATTN_EXT` line is only the post-mark interval and must not be interpreted as the kernel time.

## Context-depth measurements

All points use PP2048, ub2048, FA enabled, one repetition, and no token generation. They were run sequentially with no compiler active:

```text
Existing depth    tok/s    Total Vulkan    Final large FA    Lightning Indexer    TOP_K
0                 253.44    8.041 s          0.294 s           0.095 s               0.001 s
8192              211.01    9.666 s          1.625 s           0.379 s               0.022 s

```

At 0, 8k, and 16k, total K is below the existing sparse-path gate `total_k >= 3 * (n_kv_raw + n_top_k)`. These points use the unchanged ordinary dense FA implementation, so the cooperative sparse change does not affect or regress them. At 32k, total K is 11,008 and the cooperative sparse path engages. The 32k `Final large FA` value is the `FA_TOP_K_CM (sub-op)` total; the lower-depth values are the large ordinary `FLASH_ATTN_EXT` totals.

## Next optimization target

The cooperative sparse FA remains the largest context-dependent cost at about 4.45 s total. Stage profiling indicates approximately 14.3 ms of focused-test time in gather/QK, about 1.2 ms in parallel softmax, and about 17 ms in PV/output.

The next useful work is PV and output accumulation, not TOP_K. Investigate:

- reducing repeated selected V staging across the two 32-head workgroups per token without increasing LDS enough to lose occupancy
- reducing the eight output-dimension passes or retaining more PV state in cooperative fragments/registers
- checking register count and spills for the 32 f32 output accumulators per invocation using RADV shader statistics
- alternate 32-head layouts that keep the same eight-wave occupancy but improve PV scheduling
- query-tile overlap/union gathering only if measured top-K overlap is high enough; a whole-2048-query union is unlikely to help

Do not optimize TOP_K first. At 32k it is only about 74 ms total. Lightning Indexer is about 1.13 s and is the next context-dependent target only after sparse FA improves further.

## Useful diagnostics

Force old scalar sparse path:

```bash
GGML_VK_FA_TOPK_CM=0 GGML_VK_PERF_LOGGER=1 ./build/bin/test-backend-ops perf \
  -b Vulkan0 -o FLASH_ATTN_EXT \
  -p 'kv=32768,nb=512,n_kv_raw=1024,n_top_k=512,sinks=0'
```

Force ordinary dense FA:

```bash
GGML_VK_FA_TOPK=0 GGML_VK_PERF_LOGGER=1 ./build/bin/test-backend-ops perf \
  -b Vulkan0 -o FLASH_ATTN_EXT \
  -p 'kv=32768,nb=512,n_kv_raw=1024,n_top_k=512,sinks=0'
```

Default cooperative sparse path:

```bash
GGML_VK_PERF_LOGGER=1 ./build/bin/test-backend-ops perf \
  -b Vulkan0 -o FLASH_ATTN_EXT \
  -p 'kv=32768,nb=512,n_kv_raw=1024,n_top_k=512,sinks=0'
```

Always run these sequentially. Do not run a compiler concurrently on this APU.

## Experimental raw-prefix split prototype

An uncommitted follow-up prototype was tested after commit `24c7ead76cc1a9631fa1b42b0bfa53a15169e1ba`. Check `git status` before continuing. It was initially tested with `GGML_VK_FA_TOPK_SPLIT=1`. After the successful 32k run, the split path was changed to default-on for a llama-server coherence test. Set `GGML_VK_FA_TOPK_SPLIT=0` to restore the single cooperative sparse kernel.

Stage profiling on the previously used 19,200-row sparse shape (`kv=19200,nb=2048,n_kv_raw=2304,n_top_k=512,sinks=0`) showed:

```text
cooperative QK and selected-K gather:   88.885 ms
softmax increment:                       4.909 ms
cooperative PV and output increment:   128.399 ms
full cooperative sparse kernel:        222.193 ms
```

PV and output were 57.8% of the kernel. More importantly, most active keys are not sparse: all 2,304 raw-prefix rows are contiguous, while only 512 compressed rows use top-K indices. The prototype therefore makes two attention partitions:

1. Ordinary optimized Vulkan cooperative FA processes the contiguous raw prefix.
2. The cooperative top-K shader processes only the 512 selected compressed rows.
3. The existing split-K reduction combines both online-softmax partitions and applies sinks.

This preserves the exact raw-prefix, sparse top-K, causal mask, and softmax semantics. It reuses the existing ordinary FA and split-K reduction rather than adding a new subsystem.

The exact-shape microbenchmark improved from 222.19 ms to 111.33 ms. Its steady split stages were about 62-64 ms raw-prefix FA, 43-46 ms selected sparse FA, and 3.6-3.9 ms reduction.

Correctness validation:

```bash
GGML_VK_FA_TOPK_SPLIT=1 ./build/bin/test-backend-ops test \
  -b Vulkan0 -o FLASH_ATTN_EXT -p 'n_top_k='

./build/bin/test-backend-ops test -b Vulkan0 -o FLASH_ATTN_EXT
```

Results were 8/8 sparse top-K cases and 13,296/13,296 complete Vulkan FA cases against the CPU reference. No NaN or Inf failure occurred.

Canonical 32k prototype command:

```bash
GGML_VK_FA_TOPK_SPLIT=1 GGML_VK_PERF_LOGGER=1 ./build/bin/llama-bench \
  -m ~/Projects/docker/localLLaMA/models/models--unsloth--DeepSeek-V4-Flash-0731-GGUF/snapshots/109848da2469efe1f1aab9e11acea08a065ccd4f/UD-IQ3_XXS/DeepSeek-V4-Flash-0731-UD-IQ3_XXS-00001-of-00004.gguf \

  > /tmp/dsv4-vulkan-split-32k.log 2>&1
```

Final 32k result:

```text
32k context, PP 2048, ub 2048

Old scalar:          112.29 tok/s, 18.1957 s total, 8.84496 s sparse FA
Committed coopmat:   152.32 tok/s, 13.4032 s total, 4.44701 s sparse FA
Experimental split: 208.70 tok/s,  9.7704 s total, 1.20170 s split sparse FA

Experimental split stages:
raw-prefix FA:       0.210775 s total, 10.037 ms/layer
selected sparse FA:  0.908190 s total, 43.247 ms/layer
split reduction:     0.082732 s total,  3.940 ms/layer
Lightning Indexer:   1.110410 s total, 52.877 ms/layer
TOP_K:               0.077394 s total,  3.685 ms/layer
```

Relative to the committed cooperative path, throughput improved 37.0%, total Vulkan time fell 27.1%, and sparse FA time fell 73.0%. Relative to the old scalar path, throughput improved 85.9%, total Vulkan time fell 46.3%, and sparse FA time fell 86.4%.

The initial split implementation used 538,968,064 bytes (514 MiB) of scratch at PP2048 because each of two partitions stored an f32 partial output for 512 dimensions x 64 heads x 2048 queries, plus L/M data. This was subsequently reduced by query tiling as described below.

The old sparse selection heuristic required `total_k >= 3 * active_k`. For the coherence test it now selects sparse attention whenever `total_k > active_k`; equality still uses dense FA because no keys are pruned. The shape, capability, and allocation gates remain unchanged.

## Llama-server coherence check

After making the split path default-on and changing the sparse crossover to `total_k > active_k`, `llama-server` produced a coherent response from a 2,044-token prompt at significant context depth. The final profiler block confirmed that all 21 sparse-attention layers used the split path:

```text
FA_TOP_K_RAW:       0.179223 s total,  8.534 ms/layer
FA_TOP_K_SELECTED:  0.886629 s total, 42.220 ms/layer
FA_TOP_K_REDUCE:    0.083240 s total,  3.964 ms/layer
Split sparse FA:    1.149092 s total, 54.719 ms/layer
Lightning Indexer:  1.054610 s total, 50.220 ms/layer
TOP_K:               0.044540 s total,  2.121 ms/layer
Total Vulkan:        9.797560 s
```

This closely matches the canonical PP2048 llama-bench result of 9.770 s total and 1.202 s split sparse FA. The focused sparse CPU-reference test was rerun after the crossover change and passed 8/8 cases.

## Tiled split scratch optimization

Commit `4bbe53e4775f0707de8158e4977a16ab770829da` used two full PP2048 output partitions. The same two-partition algorithm now processes at most 256 query tokens per tile and reuses the split scratch between tiles. Q, mask, top-K, and destination descriptors are offset to the tile while K/V remain shared. A Vulkan pipeline barrier separates reuse of each scratch tile.

Scratch at PP2048 changed from:

```text
Before: 538,968,064 bytes (514 MiB)
After:   67,371,008 bytes (64.25 MiB)
Change:  8x reduction
```

The previously used 19,200-row microbenchmark (`kv=19200,nb=2048,n_kv_raw=2304,n_top_k=512,sinks=0`) measured:

```text
Full-batch two partitions: 114.65 ms
256-query tiled path:      113.70 ms
```

Two one-partition alternatives were tested and discarded. Merging the raw partial directly inside the cooperative selected shader measured 119.17 ms. Writing selected output separately and using a lightweight merge kernel measured 120.45 ms. Both cut scratch in half but regressed because writing selected output outside the contiguous split layout increased the selected stage from about 44 ms to about 51 ms. Query tiling preserves the faster memory layout.

Canonical 32k result after tiling:

```text
32k context, PP 2048, ub 2048

Full-batch split: 208.70 tok/s, 9.77039 s total, 1.20170 s sparse FA
Tiled split:      209.62 tok/s, 9.72897 s total, 1.18721 s sparse FA

Tiled split stages:
raw-prefix FA:       0.192879 s total, 168 tile dispatches
selected sparse FA:  0.910153 s total, 168 tile dispatches
split reduction:     0.084179 s total, 168 tile dispatches
Lightning Indexer:   1.100230 s total
TOP_K:               0.075158 s total
```

The 168 dispatch count is eight tiles x 21 sparse-attention layers. Relative to the full-batch split path, throughput improved 0.44%, total Vulkan time fell 0.42%, and sparse FA time fell 1.21%. The main result is the 8x scratch reduction without a performance regression.

Final correctness after removing the discarded merge prototypes:

- focused sparse top-K suite: 9/9 passed against the CPU reference, including a 257-query tile-boundary case
- complete Vulkan Flash Attention suite: 13,296/13,296 passed
- no NaN or Inf failure

## Selected PV probability reuse

The selected cooperative-matrix stage remained the largest split sparse-FA component. Profiling the tiled 19,200-row shape showed:

```text
selected K gather and cooperative QK:  about 20.0 ms
QK plus softmax:                       about 22.3 ms
full selected stage:                   about 45.5 ms
cooperative PV and output increment:   about 23.2 ms
```

PV and output were about 51% of the selected stage. The shader previously loaded each of four 16x16 probability cooperative-matrix fragments again for every one of the eight 64-dimension PV passes. The optimized shader loads these four fragments once per 64-key block and retains them across all PV dimension passes. This follows the probability-fragment lifetime used by ordinary cooperative Vulkan FA.

The shader also aliases the shared score and PV-output matrices because their lifetimes do not overlap. Shader resource statistics changed as follows:

```text
                         Before    After
VGPRs                    192       192
VGPR spills              0         0
LDS                      36,864    28,672 bytes
static instructions      11,524    11,358
```

The 19,200-row microbenchmark changed from 113.70 ms for the committed tiled path to 110.11 ms. The selected stage fell from about 45.5 ms to about 43.7 ms. The raw-prefix and reduction implementations are unchanged.

Two canonical 32k runs after this change measured:

The two-run selected-stage improvement is 5.5-6.6%, and the complete split sparse-FA improvement is 4.4-5.0%. The two-run throughput mean is 210.30 tok/s, 0.32% above the 209.62 tok/s reference. End-to-end noise in unrelated model kernels is larger than this small total-throughput change, but both profiler runs isolate a consistent gain in the modified selected stage.

Correctness after the change:

- focused sparse top-K suite: 9/9 passed against the CPU reference
- complete Vulkan Flash Attention suite: 13,297/13,297 passed
- pipeline statistics probe: 1/1 passed, with no SGPR or VGPR spills
- no NaN or Inf failure

The next sparse-FA optimization should continue to target the selected PV/output half. The retained probability fragments remove redundant cooperative loads without increasing reported VGPR allocation. More invasive changes such as doubling the PV dimension tile can reduce barriers but must be designed around the eight available wave64 subgroups, 64 KiB LDS limit, and already high 192-VGPR allocation. Do not build a crossover matrix until the next kernel layout is settled because an optimization can shift the crossover.

## Selected mask caching and deep-context micro matrix

The sparse FA `kv` dimension is compressed K/V rows, not source-token context depth. For the tested DeepSeek V4 graph, a PP2048 batch uses 2,304 raw rows and approximately one compressed row per four source tokens. The useful synthetic mapping is:

```text
Source context    Sparse FA kv rows
32k               11,008
64k               19,200
128k              35,584
256k              68,352
512k             133,888
```

The performance test registry now contains PP2048 cases at all five K extents with `n_kv_raw=2304` and `n_top_k=512`. Use this command template and replace `KV` with a value from the table:

```bash
GGML_VK_PERF_LOGGER=1 ./build/bin/test-backend-ops perf \
  -b Vulkan0 -o FLASH_ATTN_EXT \
  -p 'kv=KV,nb=2048,n_kv_raw=2304,n_top_k=512,sinks=0'
```

These are synthetic sparse-FA depth tests. They do not include the Lightning Indexer or the rest of the model graph and do not replace the canonical 32k llama-bench.

The selected shader previously loaded the same selected-key mask value independently for all 32 heads during both softmax passes. The shader now loads each mask value once per 64-key block and reuses it from LDS. Q and probability storage also share one LDS allocation, while K and V staging share another because both pairs have disjoint lifetimes.

Shader resources changed from the probability-reuse commit:

```text
                         Before    After
VGPRs                    192       192
VGPR spills              0         0
LDS                      28,672    24,576 bytes
static instructions      11,358    11,233
```

A 128-dimension V staging experiment was correct but rejected. With operand aliasing it used exactly 32 KiB LDS. It was 2.3% slower at simulated 32k, approximately equal at 64k, and 1.6% faster at 128k. The retained 64-dimension layout is better for the canonical 32k target and is simpler.

Selected-mask caching improved every synthetic depth relative to the same 64-dimension operand-alias layout:

```text
Depth    Selected before    Selected after    Split total before    Split total after
32k      43.16 ms           41.23 ms          109.45 ms             108.07 ms
64k      43.22 ms           41.42 ms          110.45 ms             109.11 ms
128k     52.26 ms           48.74 ms          119.15 ms             116.92 ms
256k     51.64 ms           49.02 ms          118.06 ms             116.93 ms
512k     51.33 ms           49.20 ms          117.87 ms             116.27 ms
```

The 256k case exposed a separate path-selection cutoff. The raw-prefix ordinary FA dispatch encoded its mask row stride in 16 bits and disabled split sparse FA above 65,535 K rows. It now uses a flagged convention that carries the full 32-bit mask stride in the existing `split_kv` push constant for this one-partition partial-output dispatch. No push-constant structure was enlarged. At simulated 256k, this changes the selected path from unsplit cooperative sparse FA at 206.22 ms to split sparse FA at 118.06 ms before mask caching, a 42.8% reduction. The 512k case also uses the split path successfully.

Canonical 32k PP2048 after operand aliasing and selected-mask caching:

Split sparse FA:          1.10160 s

Lightning Indexer:        1.102230 s
TOP_K:                    0.072488 s
```

The selected stage improves 3.4-4.5% and complete split sparse FA improves 2.3-3.0% relative to the previous commit's two canonical runs. End-to-end throughput remains within model-wide benchmark noise.

Correctness:

- focused sparse top-K suite: 9/9 passed
- complete Vulkan Flash Attention suite: 13,297/13,297 passed
- no NaN or Inf failure
- simulated 256k and 512k performance cases both selected the split path and completed successfully

Benchmark policy for this laptop APU: do not repeat llama-bench when the exact-shape microbenchmarks and the first canonical profiler block agree. Sustained load can lower GPU clocks and bias a repeat. Repeat only when the first result is anomalous or contradicts the microbenchmarks. Never build and benchmark concurrently.
